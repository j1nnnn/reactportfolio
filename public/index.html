                Hello, there! Welcome to my Professional Development Website! Here you will be able to see my background, history, talents, accomplishments, and skills.
                For a very long time, I have struggled to have this website up because of my lack of motivation and inspiration during my earlier years of my career. 
                That's why this website will be available to many, whether it be for recruiting or for some general help on website development. I believed having a 
                resume in a form a website would be nice as it would encourage me to keep coding and explore new gateways to different technologies. This is where you 
                could say my step one of accomplishing anything personal! <br><br>
                My name is Jinwoo Lim. I was born in Korea, but moved to New Jersey when I was a 19 months old. From there is history and many of the experiences I
                had gone through brought life to many ideas, concepts, and skills that helped me become who I am today. As of right now, I am 22 and a Tech Analyst 
                at Wells Fargo. I am going to be a Software Engineer at Wells Fargo specializing .Net, Full stack development and cloud technology. I have experiences
                in many different things besides what I do at Wells Fargo and you will see throughout my website the accomplishments that I was fortunate enough to 
                achieve. Throughout my life I have set my eyes on the beautiful mindset of Agile and the amazing practicalities that come with software engineering.
